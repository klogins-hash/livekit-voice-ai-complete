## üéØ How to Use

### Voice Commands Examples

**Email Automation**:
- "Send an email to sarah@company.com with the subject 'Meeting Tomorrow'"
- "Check my latest emails from Gmail"
- "Forward that email to the team"

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### 1. User Request
User speaks: *"Send an email to john@company.com about the meeting"*

### 2. Tool Discovery
Agent calls `search_app_tools()` to find relevant tools:
- Discovers `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` tool
- Gets session ID for workflow tracking

### 3. Workflow Execution
Agent calls `execute_app_workflow()` to perform the action:
- Executes email sending
- Returns success/failure status

### 4. User Feedback
Agent responds: *"I've sent the email to John about the meeting successfully!"*
