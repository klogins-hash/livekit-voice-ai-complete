# üîß RUBE MCP Integration - Current Status & Solution

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **RUBE API Key**: Properly configured in environment
- **Agent Structure**: Function tools defined for RUBE integration
- **MCP Dependencies**: Installed and ready
- **Frontend Integration**: Voice interface operational

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **Direct MCP Tool Access**: The agent can't directly call RUBE MCP tools
- **Real App Automation**: Currently using mock responses
- **Authentication Flow**: No real app connection process

## üéØ The Issue

The RUBE MCP tools (`mcp0_rube__RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS`, etc.) are available in **this current session context** but not directly accessible within the LiveKit agent's execution environment. The agent runs in its own process and doesn't have access to the MCP tools that are available here.

## üí° Solution Options

### Option 1: MCP Proxy Service (Recommended)

Create a proxy service that bridges the agent to RUBE MCP tools:

```python
# rube_proxy_server.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/search-tools")
async def search_tools(request: dict):
    # This would run in the MCP-enabled environment
    result = await mcp0_rube__RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS(request)
    return result

@app.post("/execute-workflow")
async def execute_workflow(request: dict):
    result = await mcp0_rube__RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL(request)
    return result
```

Then update the agent to call this proxy:

```python
# In agent.py
async def search_app_tools(self, context: RunContext, task_description: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post("http://localhost:8000/search-tools", json={
            "use_case": task_description,
            "known_fields": "",
            "session": {"generate_id": True}
        })
        return response.json()
```

### Option 2: Direct MCP Integration

Modify the agent to run within an MCP-enabled environment where RUBE tools are directly accessible.

### Option 3: HTTP API Integration

Use RUBE's direct HTTP API instead of MCP tools:

```python
async def call_rube_api(endpoint: str, data: dict):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"https://rube.app/api/{endpoint}",
            headers={"Authorization": os.getenv("RUBE_API_KEY")},
            json=data
        )
        return response.json()
```

## üöÄ Immediate Working Solution

Let me create a working RUBE proxy that you can use right now:

### Step 1: Create RUBE Proxy Service

I'll create a simple HTTP proxy that can actually call the RUBE MCP tools from this session context.

### Step 2: Update Agent to Use Proxy

The agent will make HTTP calls to the proxy service instead of trying to call MCP tools directly.

### Step 3: Test Real Integration

Once the proxy is running, the agent will be able to perform real app automation.

## üîß Implementation

Let me implement the working solution now...
